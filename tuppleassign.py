# 1] A complex number is a number of the form a + bi, whereby a and b are constants, and i is a special value 
# that is defined as the square root of -1. Of course, you never try to actually calculate what the square root of -1 is,
# as that gives a runtime error; in complex numbers, you always let the i remain. For instance,
# the complex number 3 + 2i cannot be simplified any further. Addition of two complex numbers a + bi and c + di is defined
# as (a + c) + (b + d)i. Represent a complex number as a tuple of two numeric values, and create a function that
# calculates the addition of two complex numbers. 
# import math
# k=math.sqrt(49)
# print(k)
t=((int a,int c),(int b,int d)i)
k=(a+bi)+(c+di)
a=int(input("enter the value of a"))
