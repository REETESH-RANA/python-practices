# Grades are values between zero and 10 (both zero and 10 included), and are always rounded to the nearest half point.
# To translate grades to the American style, 8.5 to 10 become an “A,” 7.5 and 8 become a “B,” 6.5 and 7 become a “C,” 5.5
# and 6 become a “D,” and other grades become an “F.” Implement this translation, whereby you ask the user for a grade, 
# and then give the American translation. If the user enters a grade lower than zero or higher than 10, 
# just give an error message. You do not need to handle the user entering grades that do not end in .0 or .5, 
# though you may do that if you like – in that case, if the user enters such an illegal grade, give an appropriate error message.
