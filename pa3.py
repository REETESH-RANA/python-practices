# Write code that can compute the surface of circle, using the variables radius and pi = 3.14159.
#  The formula, in case you do not know, is radius times radius times pi.
#  Print the outcome of your program as follows: “The surface area of a circle with radius ...is ...”
radius = float(input("enter the radius of the circle:"))
pi = 3.14159
area_circle = pi*radius*radius
